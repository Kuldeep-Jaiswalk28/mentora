Develop the Mentora app’s Progress Tracking and Smart Nudging System to intelligently monitor, analyze, and reinforce user performance across all blueprint-defined tasks. This system should function without any manual input from the user — all task data must be automatically managed based on the predefined blueprint structure.

Design the module with a combination of structured data logging, automated analytics, and AI-powered recommendations. Use the guidelines below for full feature design:

1. Automated Daily Logging
Every task in the schedule (which comes from the blueprint) must be:

Logged with status: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, or Missed.

Automatically updated by Mentora’s internal system based on time and user interaction. If time has passed and the user hasn’t marked a task, auto-mark as Missed.

Each day’s data should be saved in a local JSON or DB file:

{
  "date": "2025-05-15",
  "tasks": [
    { "name": "Physics Chapter 1", "category": "Class 11", "status": "Completed", "start": "09:00", "end": "09:50" },
    { "name": "Freelance: Logo Design", "category": "Freelancing", "status": "Missed" }
  ]
}
2. Task Completion Metrics
Calculate these automatically per day and per week:

Total tasks completed vs scheduled

Completion rate per category (Study, Freelancing, Certification, AI, Career)

Streaks (e.g., “3 days of full completion in a row”)

Consistency score: Use a formula like
((Total completed tasks in last 7 days / Total scheduled tasks in last 7 days) × 100)

Generate user-friendly insights:

“Your AI learning tasks had a 100% completion rate this week — excellent!”

“Freelancing tasks dropped by 30%. Let’s plan a lighter schedule or adjust timing?”

3. Smart Nudging System
Add real-time nudging with intelligent AI feedback:

If a task is missed repeatedly → nudge gently with suggestions:

“You’ve missed 3 Cybersecurity tasks. Want to reschedule or swap them to a fresher time slot?”

If a user completes multiple tasks on time → praise with feedback:

“Back-to-back wins on your studies today! Keep the energy up.”

Nudges should appear via in-app notifications or on-screen cards with emoji reactions to feel alive and human.

4. Weekly Report Card
Every Sunday night (or any preset day), Mentora auto-generates a weekly performance report, delivered as a motivational summary with recommendations.

Include:

Completion % across all categories

Best task of the week

Missed tasks summary

Suggested improvements

Weekly quote or encouragement

Format:

yaml

📅 Week Summary: May 12 – May 18

✅ Tasks Completed: 24 / 30 (80%)
🔁 Missed Tasks: 6
🧠 Best Focused Area: Class 11 (100% completion)
⚠️ Attention Needed: Freelancing (50% completion)

🌟 Great progress this week. Let’s aim for >85% next week! Remember: ‘Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated daily.’ — James Clear
5. Daily Reflection & Reward System (Optional)
Add an optional nightly reflection prompt:

“Would you like to reflect on your day, Mentora-style?”

Mentora: “What was one thing you’re proud of today?”

User types answer → saved in reflections.json.

Add a badge system (gamified) to reward consistency:

🔥 5-Day Streak Master

🎯 100 Tasks Completed

🚀 Full Week Without Misses

6. Data Visualization Module (Optional Later)
Build a UI component for visualizing:

Completion graphs (daily/weekly)

Category heatmaps

Progress over months

7. Integration with Mentor AI
Ensure all progress and metrics are available to the AI Mentor (Prompt 3) so it can:

Use real performance to motivate or advise

Personalize feedback based on strengths/weaknesses

Know when to be tough vs gentle

Architecture Note:
Separate all analytics logic into a progressEngine.js or progressTracker.ts module.

All nudges, insights, and weekly reports should be generated by combining this module with the AI agent.

Build this Progress Tracker and Smart Nudging System so Mentora never misses a beat — and keeps the user on the highest-performance path, without them having to manage it manually.
